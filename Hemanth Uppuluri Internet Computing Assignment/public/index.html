				When it comes to its weather, it is chilly. That does not come as a surprise given the relationship between temperature and altitude. The climate is interesting. If you are in the sun, it will feel warm. However, once the sun goes or you move to shade, you will start freezing. During winter, the temperatures range from below 0 degrees to 6 degrees Celsius. One should expect a rainy season from May to September. During that time, it can rain for over two hours daily. It is advisable that you visit the place during the period from October to February.

It is also an ideal place for camping and hiking. If you want to walk around, there are various nature trails. They include Ang Ka Luang and Kiu Mae Pan (Kew Mae Pan). The latter is the most common one. Its distance is about 360 meters. For the other one, you need a guide for assistance. Another exciting feature is the villages and markets. The markets are two while the communities are several.Another feature is the stupas. There are two temples at the peak. They are the sites that attract the most tourists.

			<h1 style="text-align: center;">Tiny Atlas Quarterly</h1>

					The islands, deep in the Pacific, offer tropical landscapes, a reef accessible in minutes, world class surf and surf photography, turquoise lagoons brimming with marine life, and the warmest Tahitian hospitality. Tiny Atlas Quarterly and our trip partners Earth Missions x AllSwell Creative hosted an epic island-hopping adventure on Mo’orea and Tahiti in collaboration with Adobe Stock who partnered with Tiny Atlas and the photographers below to produce best-in-class photography.
			</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
			<br>
					After landing in Pape’ete, we traveled by ferry to the island of Mo'orea, staying right on the lagoon in over-water bungalows. Days in Mo’orea were measured in sunrises, mountain photo hikes, fresh cooked family meals, drone flights, boat rides, sting ray swims and lemon shark underwater encounters. Departing Mo’orea we travelled to Tahiti, staying just past “the end of the road” in Teahupo’o in local homes and bungalows accessible only by driving a pickup truck through a river or via a foot bridge and across a lush local neighborhood. In Teahupo’o our crew experienced this gorgeous land mostly from the water via daily boat adventures with our local guide Milton: capturing pro surfers on one of the most epic waves in the world, swimming in the rain in waterfall fed fresh rivers and sailing out to the remote atoll of Tetiaroa.

				Throughout the trip our group of photographers/influencers explored Adobe Stock’s portfolio of tools adobe that helps emerging photographers connect their work with a larger audience. At Tiny Atlas we hear so often from photographers that they are shooting amazing work and trying to figure out how to translate that into client relationships, i.e. getting paid for their creativity. Becoming an Adobe Stock contributor represents one opportunity to do just that.

			<h1 style="text-align: center;">Shi Shi Beach and the Dark Age of Travel</h1>
			<p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 10px">4/3/2020</p>

			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
			<br>
			My plan is to backpack the Shi Shi Beach trail, nestled between broad Pacific bays at the northwestern tip of the forty-eight states.I am driving north on the eastern side of the Olympic Peninsula. The fog is dense this morning, I only know the Hood Canal, a 65-mile fjord, is to my right because it’s on the map.A semi busts out of the fog, hauling down the road and shaking the Jeep, jarring me enough that I want to pull over, let the fog lift. I ease to the side of the road, get out, climb over a concrete rail, onto a set of boulders next to a shallow bridge.At the base of the bridge is a small beach camp and a smoldering fire. A pewter pot is coming to a boil. Next to the pot is a spoon, a plate, a frayed and sunworn lawn chair.
			</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
			<br>
					I look under the bridge, but nobody is there.The smell of the air is the smell of the ocean— brine, seaweed, sulphur and sea creatures. It lures me out, onto a crunchy marine surface. When I finally get close enough to the water to see its silvery surface, I realize I’m walking on oyster shells.A shift in the mist and I can see the sea for just a moment; I wonder where the man or woman who was boiling water on this shore has gone.Who is this person? A traveler out to shuck fresh oysters? A local shellfisherman? A vagabond, making a meager existence at the edge?  Whoever it is, I cannot help but to paint the picture of an older man, stooped over his teapot, sleeping under a low bridge.
			</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
			<br>
					Scenes like this haunt me, even more so this week: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just updated its assessments; the picture is at odds with the one that’s been reported in the newspapers of the world.  The journalists, perennially painting for us a story of hurricanes, wildfires, drought and rising seas - a world I could reconcile with.Today, some journalists on the radio are connecting what the IPCC report is actually saying; that civilization itself is at stake; that we’re peering directly at our singular, ultimate and final failure.
			</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
			<br>
					There has been no other time in history, when so many roads are open to so many people around the world, aided by so much technology and transportation and tolerance.  You can be young, old, female, an ethnic minority, on limited means, gay, disabled, and you have opportunities to go places like no time before.While this peninsula is so close to the Seattle metropolis and the successful, vibrant economy of the Pacific Northwest, this place feels as rural as anywhere I’ve ever seen. Quaint, lonely, unpopulated, worn with moss and lichen between its cracks.
